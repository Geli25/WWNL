      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p> Hi! I'm Angelina Liu, welcome to <i>When We Are No Longer</i> and thanks for scrolling to the bottom of the page!
        This is a text-based adventure game that I have created this website/game as the conjunction of final projects for two classes: <i>Web-based Multimedia Communications</i>
        and <i>Techno-Orientalism</i>. The game itself is created from a software called Squiffy. As both a writer and web-developer I am still quite amateur, but I am excited to be able to incorporate web design elements to add atmosphere to the game!</p>
      <p>This game speaks about many topics that I am personally interested in, as such the concept of humanity, the concept of sex and race defining our sense of identity, and the fantasies we may hold
        for technology. This game is one of those fantasies, and I hope you enjoy it!</p>
      <h6>P.S. There might be a hidden ending in this game, can you find it?</h6>
